## Final Project Security Measures

### Using Specific Compiler Pragma
- SWC-103 (Floating Pragma)
- Lock the pragma version and also consider known bugs for the compiler version that is chosen

### Proper Use of Require, Assert, and Revert
- SWC-110 Assert Violation
- assert() function is meant to assert invariants
