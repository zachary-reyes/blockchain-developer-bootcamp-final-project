## What are NFTs???

A non-fungible token is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger. NFTs can be associated with easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use blockchain technology to give the NFT a public proof of ownership.

## Local Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Chrome || Brave Browser 
- MetaMask browser extension (This is how we talk to the blockchain!)
- Node.js && npm (download LTS from nodejs.org)
- Ganache GUI (Personal Blockchain for Testing) && Truffle Framework (Makes it easy to develop Ethereum smart contracts in Solidity) trufflesuit.com
- Optional but helpful: IDE or Text editor of choice (I prefer VScode!)

### Contracts
- Run `npm install -g truffle@5.0.5` in project root. 
**Very important that this specific Truffle version is used**
- Run `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` to deploy smart contracts and run local tests 
- Open new tab in the terminal, and in the project root directory, run the development server with `npm run start`. If page does not automatically load in your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000/

## Connecting to MetaMask Wallet
- Make sure you are connected to the localhost port 7545 
([Ganache](https://dapp-world.com/blogs/01/how-to-connect-ganache-with-metamask-and-deploy-smart-contracts-on-remix-without-1619847868947)) network
- Import the first account from Ganache into your Metamask wallet
*This seemed easier to me than using a public testnet where one has to scavenge for testETH faucets*
