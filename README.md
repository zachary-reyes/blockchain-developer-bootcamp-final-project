    I am still very new to this space and this idea may evolve but for now...

## Final Project Proposal: In-Game Exclusive NFTs

    The idea here is that when games like Fortnite were introduced, the players were able to customize their characters with 'skins'. In order to obtain these, the player had to buy vbucks. I am proposing a marketplace that allows amateur artists and NFT creators to sell their 'skins' directly to gamers. 

1. Users will register themselves on the contract with their gamer accounts

2. They have to identify which skin they would like to buy 

3. They'll have to submit a payment to the artist

4. This can either be bid based or the marketplace can allow anyone to buy the same skin from an artist   

## SCAFFOLD/PIVOT??

So I am very behind and having conflicting ideas. I have been asked recently to help start a DAO so I kind of want to pivot my idea in that direction. I will simply submit my url for scaffolding credit and hope the DAO and remaining sections can give me a better idea of where to go.
